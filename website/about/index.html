            <span class="mid-title">JOH</span> was born from a passion to share the mindset and discipline of boxing. In Dutch, “Joh”
            is a casual expression meaning <i>obviously</i>, and that’s exactly our goal: to make boxing feel
            natural and accessible to everyone.
            What started as a simple training session, is now giving everyday people the tools to build
            confidence, discipline, and energetic self-expression. Today, <span class="mid-title">JOH</span>. offers boxing sessions in
            Amsterdam, providing 1-on-1 training, small group classes, and soon tailored programs for
            organizations.
